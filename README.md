# App - LunarOps: Lunar Surface Operations - Realtime Collaboration

In an effort to enhance the documentation and review process of data collected on the Moon, NASA and the global scientific community are moving towards a system where information is documented and reviewed in real time.

## Current Implementation
During missions, each flight control team member is responsible for creating and maintaining a log that supports their specific job duties. These logs form the official mission record. However, the current system does not allow flight controllers to view each otherâ€™s logs in real time or synchronize logs for comparison during or after missions.


## Project Objective
Develop an application capable of integrating and displaying console log information from multiple users (100+ users on the same network) instantly and seamlessly.
